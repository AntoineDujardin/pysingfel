# pysingfel
This is a new repo of pysingfel maintained by Haoyuan. It is not quite compatible with the original with Zhaoyou's implementation.

The documentation is not complete. There are also known bugs not fixed in this repo.
The author is preparing this oral qualification exam and will return and fix them after April 13th.

Please contact hyli16@stanford.edu, if you come across any problems.

# Note
1. Throughout this package, the unit of all energy variables is eV. The unit of length variables is meter.
2. The wavenumber, wavevector is defined without 2\pi. It means that if k is the wavenumber, then k= 1/wavelength.
